Project Design Hand-off - https://jazzy-vacherin-1be84d.netlify.app/

🏁 Goals:

For this project I got to experience a design hand-off from a UX-design student and work on transforming that design into code. It is a landing page for a yoga club and it was to be built in React. I kept structure of the site, what components to create and trying to use styled components in mind. Main goal was to follow the design given thoroughly.

Another goal was to also make use of npm-packages to create an image carousel in the design.

Overall this project went well. Time was short, but I managed to make site that looks like the given design. I made use of the npm package and made carousels and also added a pop-up module. 

I am content with the final product but there are many details that I feel needs to be tended to and I would definitely made some things differently the second time around. For example, I would have made the carousels in a different way so both could be tweaked separately in a better fashion. I would also have used styled components in the entire project.

Must-have requirements:

✅  The app should be built with React (and preferably Styled Components).

✅ Your app should have reusable components.

✅ Your app should look as close as possible to the given design.

🚧 The problem:

I started by going through the design, thinking about which components I should use and how I should structure the project. I then dove into building the landing page and looking into what packages there were for the carousel. As I had a little extra time later on, I added the pop-up module as well.

If we had more time, I would have done a better job structuring the project and cleaned up the code. I would also made the hamburger menu functional.
